1. CI/CD Workflow Explained

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment) is an automated software development practice that streamlines the process of code changes from development to production. Here's a breakdown of the workflow:

a. Continuous Integration (CI):

Developers frequently commit their code changes to a shared version control system (VCS) like Git.
Upon each commit or merge, an automated build process is triggered.
This build process typically involves:
Fetching the latest code from the VCS.
Compiling or building the code into a deployable artifact.
Running automated tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
Feedback on the build and test results is provided to developers quickly, allowing them to identify and fix issues early.
b. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):

If the automated tests in CI pass successfully, the CD pipeline takes over.
The CD pipeline automates the packaging, delivery, and deployment of the application to different environments (staging, production).
Continuous Delivery (CD): Involves automated delivery of the application to a staging environment, ready for manual deployment to production after approval.
Continuous Deployment (CD): Involves fully automated deployment of the application directly to production, typically used when high levels of confidence and stability exist.

Benefits of CI/CD:

Faster software delivery cycles
Improved software quality
Reduced manual errors
Increased developer productivity
More efficient collaboration
